# Open ONI

Welcome to the Open Online Newspapers Initiative (Open ONI)! Open ONI is a community-managed group formed to create and maintain a state-based fork of the Library of Congress Newspaper Viewer software (chronam). It leverages features developed by individual libraries and merges them into a single distribution. The new data model allows lighter weight metadata making it easier for smaller organizations to utilize.

## Open ONI Successes

* Community-managed group and participants for state-based fork
* Bootstrap based Django template built for easy overrides
* Fast Docker based development environment
* Update of many dependencies to contemporary versions (Solr, python libraries, etc)
* Integration of existing features
  * City/County search and browse
  * rights metadata and display
* Plugin architecture
